1. [x] create the TBN matrix for proper lighting calculations
2. [] Global lighting model (maybe) (raytracing?) (radiance cascades!!)
        - So first:
        - Have to spawn "NODES" with lower angular and lower linear resolution
            - Save this in 
3. [] implement SSAO
4. [] Research about how to add subsurface scattering
